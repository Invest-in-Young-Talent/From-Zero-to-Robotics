# A Self-Learning Journey to Building and Understanding Robots

## About the Initiative

This repository is part of the **Invest in Young Talent** initiative founded by **Dr. Khaldon Araffa**. The initiative aims to empower young learners to explore robotics and technology through innovative educational methods. By following the **Start from the End** approach, students are guided to define their goals and work backward to achieve them, fostering independence and practical problem-solving skills.

### Proposed Course Outline for Shaid

This course is designed to guide Shaid from a beginner to a proficient level in robotics. Through hands-on tasks and self-learning, Shaid will gain the skills necessary to build and understand robotics systems, ultimately contributing to the **Niava Robot** project.
